## Hi there 👋

The best thing about coding is having the power to create anything you can imagine in the digital world.

It’s just the bugs that get in the way. And they aren't just bad, they're much, much worse.

Fixing a bug is like being the detective and the killer in a mystery. The crime is always the same: "Build Failed." After hours of searching for clues, you find the murder weapon—a single missing semicolon. And the motive? You were just being careless at 2 AM.

Honestly, moments like these make me think living in caves wasn't such a bad idea after all. 😤😈

But really, the victory you feel after crushing those bugs is the sweetest of all. 😎🥳
