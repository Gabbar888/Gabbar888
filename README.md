## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If find that a good thing about coding is that it gives you the power to create everything you can think of in this digital world.
It's just the ``bugs`` that bug you.

But they are not as bad as you think, they are much worse.
Resolving Bugs is a special kind of mystery where you get to be both the detective and the killer. The crime is always the same: "Build Failed" After hours of searching for clues, you find the murder weapon-a single missing semicolon. And the motive? Sheer, unadulterated carelessness at 2 AM. Honestly, it's moments like these that makes me think living in caves wasn't such a bad idea afterall.ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜ˆ
But, really it's the victory over these that are the sweetest of all. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¥³
